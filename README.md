# Roblox-Client-Optimizer

This fork attempts to Fix stability issues on my device

Copy my ClientAppSettings.json to your ClientAppSettings.json or merge them (check releases too!)

- FPS is capped at 165
- Disable QuickGameLaunch(?)
- "DFFlagAlwaysPutSoundsOnDiskWhenLowOnMemory": false
- "FIntDefaultMeshCacheSizeMB": 4096

manually installing ClientAppSettings.json should work with the new Byfron update
